Dear United Nations
I am writing to you with the intention of justifying an early vacation for my cousin Gabriella Price, who is currently working as a military medic on a mission in Yemen.
I am currently going through a serious illness and I need help from the only person in my family to help me right now.

I'm sure you can help me with this request.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks


Ivan Luis Jimenez
